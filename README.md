## ✨ Why TestNavigatorPlus?

Testing shouldn’t be a chore.  
**TestNavigatorPlus** makes test development a **delightful experience** — bringing the power of navigation, filtering, visualization, and insights into your daily test workflow.

Whether you're writing new tests, debugging failures, or just trying to stay sane with hundreds of edge cases, **this extension has your back**.

  Instantly jump to the _first / next / previous / last_ test, bug (TODO/FIXME), or compiler error.

- **Smart Detection**  
  Detects test methods (xUnit, NUnit, MSTest), bookmarks, and test coverage opportunities.

- **Live Debug Insights** *(planned)*  
  A lightweight debugger visualizer: highlights changed values, tracks branches, and surfaces hidden bugs.

- **Test-to-Code Switching**  
  Jump between source and test files effortlessly.

- **AI-Powered Hints** *(future)*  
  GPT-assisted suggestions for edge cases, test gaps, and flaky failure diagnoses.

- **Code Hygiene Toolkit**  
  Clean up pasted code, normalize line spacing, and detect lazy tests automatically.
